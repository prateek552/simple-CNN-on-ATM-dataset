# simple-CNN-on-ATM-dataset
I have used Simple convolution neural network to classify videos by first breaking each video into frames and then passing
each image through the neural network.You can use the given code and put the data in testdataset and traindataset olders in the same directory as 
the code. The data should be properly classified byt adding the videos in the folders of their respective classes.
